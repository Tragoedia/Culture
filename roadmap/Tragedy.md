Tragedy's Wish list

- Automute for verityping or spamming. 5-10 minutes approximately for each. What constitutes a spammer is followed in several criterias: 
1) Types words that do not currently exist on the dictionary (in a row)
2) Posts sentences in less than 5 seconds each between 
3) Contains a mixture of all caps or a mixture between the two as well as other symbols
4) Posts URL links (relates to 2)
5) Contains swearing- vulgar language- in their text, or any amalgamation a of such.
*Violating 3/5 of these conditions would result in an Automute for 5~10 minutes.

- Option to have duels with randomly picked premade decks (provided by the server). Similar to Pokemon Showdown's mechanic of "random battles" where users are given random Pokemon with certain stats, abilties, moves and items to make up the Pokemon, users are given a deck that is premade, thus allowing users to learn something new in Yu-Gi-Oh! I suggest that the server should have at least 30-50 premade decks that may or may not consist of starter decks and/or silly yet usable decks for the format.

- Automatically save replays and upload them on YouTube or any other video player (site)... Or a file sharing site like sendspace. 

- Avatars!

- Hierachy: Guests (can only spectate and chat) < Regular Users < Premium Users (AKA Donators; can mute others in their own channel, send server messages and has sparkly sleeves to show others) < Mod (Mute, kick, etc... Cannot ban immediately unless authorized.) < or = Admin (Can kick, mute or ban. Also provides tech support and such) < Head Admin

- Link to rulings for idiots when necessary (for specific cards)
